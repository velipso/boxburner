[Boxburner](https://sean.fun/i/boxburner) is a tool for generating SVG files for laser cutting
devices.

Inspired by [boxes.py](https://github.com/florianfesti/boxes).

It is still in alpha, but can generate plain boxes with kerf/burn correction, arbitrary rectangles,
and kerf testing arrays.

It features a live preview of the final output that can be panned and zoomed, so it's easy to tell
how different parameters affect the shapes.
